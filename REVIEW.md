# Project Review

## Mikhail Bobko

Firstly I splitted task to a different subtasks, and estimated it.
Estimation was based on idea that I need to balance between application architecture and application features.
But than, when I started developing of architecture, I thought that I need to do my best, and make it easy expandable,
weakly linked and abstract depended. That was my mistake, I spended too much time for this, and when 70% of time was gone,
I realized that I steel have only moving player. More of that, architecture which I developed was not so good as I expected
and adding new features was really hard.
