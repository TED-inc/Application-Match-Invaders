### Execution time

0) architecture developing          (50% complete - 4,5h)
1) core mechanic of space invaders  (90% complete - 3h)
2) match3 mechanic                  (20% complete - 1h)
3) space invaders protectors        (100% complete - 30m)

### Review of the project (where I struggled)

Firstly I splitted task to a different subtasks, and estimated it.
Estimation was based on idea that I need to balance between application architecture and application features.
But than, when I started developing of architecture, I thought that I need to do my best, and make it easy expandable,
weakly linked and abstract depended. That was my mistake, I spended too much time for this, and when 70% of time was gone,
I realized that I steel have only moving player. More of that, architecture which I developed was not so good as I expected
and adding new features was really hard.

### Review of the project (what I learn)

I learned that I need more experience of developing architecture and importance of tracking completion progress.
Now I understand that I was able to see overengineering of my architecture after first 3 hours, and I had an opportunity to fit more features,
by suspending of attempts to create the best, and make it just good.

### Review of the project (what I liked)

Task and idea of game is really interesting, so I it steel was cool experience, and I'm planning to finish this project.
